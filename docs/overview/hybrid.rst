Using a Hybrid Solver
=====================

Quantum-classical hybrid is the use of both classical and quantum resources to solve problems, exploiting the complementary strengths that each provides. As quantum processors grow in size, offloading hard optimization problems to quantum computers promises performance benefits similar to CPUs' outsourcing of compute-intensive graphics-display processing to GPUs.
