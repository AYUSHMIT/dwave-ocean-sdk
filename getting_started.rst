New to `D-Wave Systems <https://www.dwavesys.com>`_ Ocean or want an overview of
the software? This section describes how the Ocean tools fit together
to solve hard problems and gives examples of using them to solve such problems
on a D-Wave quantum computer.

Overview
========

How the Ocean tools fit together to solve problems and how to use a D-Wave system.

Demonstrations
==============

* `circuit-fault-diagnosis-demo <https://github.com/dwavesystems/circuit-fault-diagnosis-demo>`_

  Demonstrates the use of the D-Wave system to solve circuit fault diagnosis, the problem of identifying
  a minimum-sized set of components that, if faulty, explains an observation of incorrect outputs given a
  set of inputs.

* factoring
